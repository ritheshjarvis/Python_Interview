Encapsulation:
    Definition: The bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, with controlled access to the internal state.
    Purpose: To protect an objectâ€™s internal state and expose a controlled interface.
    Implementation: Achieved through private and protected members.

Abstraction:
    Definition: The concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
    Purpose: To simplify interaction with objects by focusing on high-level operations rather than implementation details.
    Implementation: Achieved through abstract classes and methods, interfaces, and high-level class design.
