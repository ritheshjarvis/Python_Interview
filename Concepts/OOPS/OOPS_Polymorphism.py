Polymorphism in Python
Polymorphism means "many forms." In Python, it allows the same interface (method name) to be used for different types of objects.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
When a child class provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.
Method Signature: The name of the method + the parameter list (types and order).

üîπ Example:
"""

class Animal:
    def make_sound(self):
        print("Some generic animal sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):  # Overriding parent method
        print("Bark!")

class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):  # Overriding parent method
        print("Meow!")

# Common interface
animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Animal()]

for animal in animals:
    animal.make_sound()
"""
‚úÖ Output:
Bark!
Meow!
Some generic animal sound

üîπ Real-World Example:
Think of a "Print" button that works differently for a PDF, Image, or Word file‚Äîeach class provides its own print behavior.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2Ô∏è‚É£ Method Overloading (Compile-Time Polymorphism)
Python does not support true method overloading (like Java), but you can achieve similar behavior using default arguments or *args and **kwargs.

üîπ Example using default arguments:
"""
class MathOperations:
    def add(self, a, b, c=0):  # Overloaded method (optional parameter)
        return a + b + c

math = MathOperations()
print(math.add(2, 3))      # Output: 5
print(math.add(2, 3, 4))   # Output: 9

# üîπ Example using *args:

class MathOperations:
    def add(self, *numbers):
        return sum(numbers)

math = MathOperations()
print(math.add(2, 3))        # Output: 5
print(math.add(2, 3, 4, 5))  # Output: 14
"""
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3Ô∏è‚É£ Operator Overloading
Python allows operators like +, -, *, etc., to be redefined for custom behavior in user-defined classes.

üîπ Example:
"""
class Box:
    def __init__(self, weight):
        self.weight = weight

    def __add__(self, other):  # Overloading the '+' operator
        return Box(self.weight + other.weight)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Box weight: {self.weight} kg"

box1 = Box(10)
box2 = Box(20)
box3 = box1 + box2  # Uses __add__ method

print(box3)  # Output: Box weight: 30 kg
"""
‚úÖ Real-World Example:
Imagine adding two bank accounts and getting a new account with their combined balance.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Duck Typing (Dynamic Polymorphism)
In Python, we don‚Äôt care about the type of an object, only whether it has the expected methods and behavior.
"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck!"

üîπ Example:
"""
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        print("Flying in the sky!")

class Airplane:
    def fly(self):
        print("Flying using jet engines!")

# Common interface
def take_off(entity):
    entity.fly()

take_off(Bird())     # Output: Flying in the sky!
take_off(Airplane()) # Output: Flying using jet engines!
"""
‚úÖ Real-World Example:
Any payment system (PayPal, Stripe, Razorpay) should have a process_payment() method, even though their implementations differ.
"""

"""
Why Real Method Overloading is Not Possible in Python?
1) Lack of static method signature
2) Python functions don‚Äôt enforce strict type checking.
