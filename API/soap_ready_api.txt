âœ… Summary:
ReadyAPI is an automated API testing platform that helps teams create, manage, and execute functional, security,
and performance tests for web services, including REST, SOAP, and GraphQL APIs
Use SoapUI if you just need basic REST/SOAP API functional testing and you're okay with limited features.

Use ReadyAPI if you're working on enterprise-grade projects and need data-driven, load, security, and mock testing,
plus CI/CD integration.
