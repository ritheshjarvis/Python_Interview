Synchronous API and Asynchronous API refer to how a program interacts with an API and waits (or doesn’t wait) for a response after making a request.

✅ Synchronous API
A synchronous API is one where the client sends a request and waits for the response before continuing. The execution is blocked until the API call completes.

🔁 Behavior:
Request → Wait for response → Continue

📦 Real-World Analogy:
Imagine you're at a fast-food counter. You place your order and stand there waiting until your food is ready before you do anything else.

✅ Pros:
Simpler to implement and understand

Useful when the result is immediately needed

❌ Cons:
Blocks the program until it gets a response

Can lead to slow performance if the API is slow

🧑‍💻 Example (Python):
python
Copy
Edit
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")  # Synchronous
print(response.json())  # This line waits for the response before printing
🚀 Asynchronous API
An asynchronous API allows the client to send a request and continue processing other tasks while waiting for the response. The response is handled later, often using a callback, promise, or future.

🔁 Behavior:
Request → Continue doing other work → Handle response when ready

📦 Real-World Analogy:
You place an order at a restaurant and the waiter gives you a buzzer. You go sit down and do other things. When your food is ready, the buzzer rings, and you go collect it.

✅ Pros:
Non-blocking – better performance for I/O-heavy tasks

More responsive applications (especially in UI or web servers)

❌ Cons:
Slightly more complex to implement and debug

Requires understanding of event loops, callbacks, etc.

🧑‍💻 Example (Python with aiohttp):
python
Copy
Edit
import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get("https://api.example.com/data") as response:
            data = await response.json()
            print(data)

asyncio.run(fetch_data())
