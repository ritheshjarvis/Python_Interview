🧠 Option 1: If you want to keep it open (safe default)
“I’m open to discussing the salary based on the overall role, responsibilities, and growth opportunities.
I trust that your company offers a fair compensation structure aligned with market standards and the value I bring.”

💡 Option 2: If you want to give a range
“Based on my experience and market research, I’m expecting a salary in the range of ₹X to ₹Y LPA.
But I’m flexible depending on the role’s responsibilities and other benefits the company provides.”

💪 Option 3: If you want to be confident and direct (with logic)

I’m looking for around ₹Y LPA. I believe this aligns with industry standards and reflects the value I can add.”
