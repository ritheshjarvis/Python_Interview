✅ Common and Safe Answer Patterns:
1. Career Growth / New Challenges
“I’ve learned a lot in my current role and am grateful for the experience, but I feel it’s the right time to take on new challenges that align more with my long-term goals. I’m looking for opportunities where I can continue to grow, learn new technologies, and take on more responsibility.”

2. Looking for Role/Technology Alignment
“I’ve realized that I’m more passionate about [backend development/data engineering/test automation/etc.],
and I want to move into a role that aligns better with that.
Unfortunately, there are limited opportunities in my current organization in this direction.”

3. Stagnation / Lack of Growth
“I felt that my growth had become stagnant in my current role. I’m looking for an environment where I can continuously learn, be challenged, and contribute meaningfully.”

4. Better Work-Life Balance or Culture Fit
“While I’m thankful for everything I’ve learned, I’m looking for a company culture and work-life balance that suits me better.”
(Only if truly relevant—avoid sounding like you’re running away from something.)

❌ What to Avoid Saying:
Bad-mouthing your current employer or manager.

Complaining about salary (unless asked directly).

Saying you were bored or not learning anything (say it more diplomatically).

⭐ Tip for Extra Impact:
End your answer by connecting it to the job you're interviewing for:

“That’s why I’m particularly excited about this role—because it offers the kind of challenges and growth I’m looking for.”
