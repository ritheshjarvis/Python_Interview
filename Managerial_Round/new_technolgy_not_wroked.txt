“I haven’t had the opportunity to work directly with Django yet, but I’ve been very interested in it because I want to strengthen my backend development skills using Python. I’ve already started going through documentation and tutorials to understand how Django handles models, views, and APIs. I’m confident that with my Python background, I can pick it up quickly and start contributing effectively if given the chance.”
