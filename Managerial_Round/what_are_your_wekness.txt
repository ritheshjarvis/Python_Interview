As i progress upwards / Moving upwards  -> in my career ladder, I understand effective communication plays a major role,
I knew myself that I'm not so good at it, I consider this as my weakness, i constantly working on it.
Communication skills improvement

2 Delegation of work

3. Too much perfection or Going into technical stack deep-dive into optimizations that aren’t always necessary for the immediate goal.
   I should impove on balancing timelines which leads to business impact and techincal depth


1. Perfectionism / Overchecking Work
“One weakness I’ve recognized is that I tend to double-check my work multiple times, especially in automation scripts,
which sometimes slows me down. I’m learning to trust my process more and use peer reviews and proper test coverage to balance quality and speed.”

2. Public Speaking / Presenting
“I used to struggle with presenting technical topics in meetings, especially to larger groups.
To improve, I’ve started volunteering to present smaller demos during team calls and have received positive feedback.
I’m still working on becoming more confident, but I’ve seen steady progress.”

3. Delegating Work
“I sometimes take on too much myself instead of delegating tasks.
I’ve been working on trusting my teammates more and collaborating better, especially during sprints.
I’ve seen that it actually speeds things up and builds better team synergy.”

4. Getting Too Deep into Technical Details
“At times, I get too focused on technical perfection and deep-dive into optimizations that aren’t always necessary for the immediate goal.
I’m now learning to better balance between business impact and technical depth.”
