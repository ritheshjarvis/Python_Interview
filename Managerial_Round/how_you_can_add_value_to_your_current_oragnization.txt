I will always look for solution -> If not solution what is best possibel workarounds
I also mentor junior or any team member whenever they need me.

i understand it is not with single person outcome -> a project leads to success
It is a Team's comphensive outcome -> which leads to Project success

I take ownership own any assgined activity till the desired outcome is met

and I do mention i have 11 experience, which will be a big plus -> since i already gone through the real obstcles, process
which we face on our day to day basis -

When you're asked "How are you adding more value to your current organization technically and functionally?", interviewers want to see:

Your technical contributions (code, automation, tools, improvements)

Your functional understanding (business needs, customer impact, process improvements)


How you go beyond your basic job role

✅ Sample Structure for Answering:
1. Start with Technical Contributions
Talk about how you've improved code, automation, performance, reliability, tools, etc.

“Technically, I’ve contributed by developing reusable Python libraries that automate repetitive tasks across projects,
reducing execution time by over 30%.
I’ve also optimized our Selenium test framework by integrating it with Jenkins for CI/CD, which helped catch bugs earlier and sped up releases.”

2. Add Functional Contributions
Explain how you understand business needs, improve workflows, or collaborate cross-functionally.

“Functionally, I work closely with product owners and business analysts to understand requirements clearly,
which helps me write more relevant test cases and catch edge cases early. I’ve also taken the initiative to create dashboards that help stakeholders visualize test coverage and release readiness.”

3. Show Ownership / Initiative
Mention any leadership, mentoring, or process improvements.

“I also mentor junior team members and help with onboarding, which improves team efficiency. I proactively identify gaps in test coverage and coordinate with developers to close them, ensuring end-to-end quality.”

4. End with the Impact
Wrap up with a measurable or qualitative result.

“All of these efforts have helped reduce production issues and improved delivery confidence with each release.”

⭐ Full Example Answer:
“Technically, I’ve built reusable Python libraries to automate our test execution and reporting process, which reduced manual effort and improved consistency. I also improved our Selenium test framework by integrating it with Jenkins and parallelizing test execution, which cut down feedback time from hours to minutes. Functionally, I take time to understand the business logic behind features and collaborate with the product team to ensure our test coverage aligns with real user scenarios. I’ve created dashboards that show release readiness to stakeholders, improving visibility. On top of that, I’ve mentored junior teammates and helped define QA best practices. These efforts have directly contributed to faster, more stable releases and better cross-team collaboration.”
