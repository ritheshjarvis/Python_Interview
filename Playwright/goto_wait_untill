🌐 Browser Page Lifecycle Events
1️⃣ commit
Very early stage of navigation.

Navigation is initiated and acknowledged by the browser, but no content has loaded yet.

No document is available yet, no DOM, no JS.

✅ Use when you're okay to proceed as soon as navigation is committed (rare).

🧠 Analogy: The browser starts traveling to the URL, but hasn't reached the destination yet.
------------------------------------------------------------------
2️⃣ domcontentloaded (event: DOMContentLoaded)
Fires when the initial HTML document is completely loaded and parsed.

No need to wait for stylesheets, images, or subframes.

JS is allowed to run, DOM is fully built.

This is the ideal choice when interacting with DOM elements early, like form fields or tables.

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    console.log("DOM is ready");
});
🧠 Analogy: The page’s skeleton is ready and interactive, but decoration (images/CSS) may still be coming.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3️⃣ load (event: load)
Waits for everything:

HTML ✅

CSS ✅

Images ✅

Iframes ✅

Fonts ✅

Scripts ✅

window.addEventListener("load", () => {
    console.log("Page fully loaded");
});
🧠 Analogy: The entire page and all its resources are loaded — like waiting until your room is fully cleaned and decorated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4️⃣ networkidle
Playwright-specific term (inspired by Puppeteer).

Waits until there are no more than 2 network connections for at least 500 ms.

Useful when the page has lazy loading, AJAX calls, or dynamic content.

🧠 Analogy: You don’t leave a web page until the internet traffic (XHR/fetch) has calmed down and stayed quiet for a bit.

📝 Summary Table
Option	JS Event	Triggers When...	Best For
"commit"	(None)	Navigation starts (request is sent)	Very early detection
"domcontentloaded"	DOMContentLoaded	HTML fully parsed, DOM ready	DOM interaction (fast & safe)
"load"	load	All resources (JS, CSS, images) loaded	Full page validation/screenshot
"networkidle"	(Playwright-only)	Network is idle (no new requests for 500ms)	Dynamic/SPAs, lazy loading pages
