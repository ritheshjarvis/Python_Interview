ðŸ§± EBS vs S3 â€” At a Glance
Feature	EBS (Elastic Block Store)	S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Type	Block storage	Object storage
Use case	Attached to EC2 like a virtual hard disk	Store files, backups, media, logs, etc.
Access	Only via attached EC2 instances	Accessible over the web or via API
Data format	Raw blocks (like a hard drive)	Files (objects) with metadata
Durability	High (within an AZ)	Extremely high (11 9s across regions)
Pricing	Pay for provisioned size	Pay for actual storage used
Persistence	Tied to EC2 lifecycle (unless configured otherwise)	Independent of compute resources
Latency	Very low (disk-like)	Higher (network-based)
Examples	Store OS, databases	Store images, PDFs, logs, backups

ðŸ§  Real-world Analogy
EBS: Like a USB hard drive attached to a computer. It stores OS, applications, and databases. Canâ€™t access it without plugging it in.

S3: Like Google Drive or Dropbox. You can store and access files anytime from anywhere.

ðŸ”§ Example Use Cases
ðŸ“€ EBS Example
You launch an EC2 instance (virtual machine) and attach a 100GB EBS volume.

You install a database (like MySQL) on it.

Data is read/written to disk â€” just like on your local laptop hard drive.

# Linux EC2 with EBS
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data
ðŸª£ S3 Example
You store images from a website in an S3 bucket called mywebsite-images.

You can upload/download them using boto3 or AWS CLI.

You donâ€™t need EC2 â€” S3 is serverless.


# Uploading to S3 using Python
import boto3
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
s3.upload_file('photo.jpg', 'mywebsite-images', 'uploads/photo.jpg')
ðŸ§¾ When to Use What?
If you need...	Use
A disk for EC2	EBS
To store documents, logs, media	S3
A fast block-level storage for databases	EBS
A scalable, serverless file store	S3
